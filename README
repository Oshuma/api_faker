API Faker
---------

This app was born from my need to test web API responses without having to actually send
a request through the tubes.  Just create a new Detail, select the content type, and
give it some guts.  You'll then be able to RESTfully test the response and not have to
worry about some lame API limit (*ahem* looks at Twitter).

Currently supports JSON, XML and YAML.


Example
-------

$ curl http://localhost:4000/details/666.json
{
  "animals": {
    "dog": [
      {
        "id": 666,
        "name": "Cerberus",
        "breed": "hellbeast"
      }
    ],
    "cat": {
      "name": "Kamichu"
    }
  }
}

$ curl http://localhost:4000/details/420.xml
